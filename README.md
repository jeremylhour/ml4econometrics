*Machine Learning for Econometrics* is a book for economists seeking to grasp modern machine learning techniques - from their predictive performance to the revolutionary handling of unstructured data - in order to establish causal relationships from data.

The volume covers automatic variable selection in various high-dimensional contexts, estimation of treatment effect heterogeneity, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, as well as synthetic control and macroeconomic forecasting. The foundations of machine learning methods are introduced to provide both a thorough theoretical treatment of how they can be used in econometrics and numerous economic applications, and each chapter contains a series of empirical examples, programs, and exercises to facilitate the reader's adoption and implementation of the techniques.

# Link between chapters

To help the reader navigate this book, the following figure shows the connection between each chapter, identified by its number. An arrow going from one node to another indicates that the originating chapter is a prerequisite for understanding the destination chapter. Apart from Chapters 2 and 3, which are not central to the main discussion, the reader may start with Chapters 4, 8, or 12, which are the first chapters of the second, third, and fifth parts respectively, or with either of the two chapters in the fourth part.
